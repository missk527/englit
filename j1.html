    <h1>1. Sympathy</h1>

    <section class="box" aria-label="Extract and question">
      <p>
        On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor&rsquo;s with a small party; Lanyon had been
        there; and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio
        were inseparable friends. On the 9th, and again on the 10th, the door was shut against the lawyer.
        &lsquo;The doctor was confined to the house,&rsquo; Poole said, &lsquo;and saw no one.&rsquo; On the 11th,
        he tried again, and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his
        friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night,
        he had in at Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Doctor Lanyon&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the change which
        had taken place in the doctor&rsquo;s appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face.
        The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and yet it was
        not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer&rsquo;s notice, as a look in the
        eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It was unlikely
        that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he
        thought; &lsquo;he is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge
        is more than he can bear.&rsquo; And yet when Utterson remarked on his ill-looks, it was with an air of great
        firmness that Lanyon declared himself a doomed man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &lsquo;I have had a shock,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I shall never recover. It is a question of weeks. Well,
        life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we
        should be more glad to get away.&rsquo; &lsquo;Jekyll is ill, too,&rsquo; observed Utterson. &lsquo;Have you seen him?&rsquo;
        But Lanyon&rsquo;s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. &lsquo;I wish to see or hear no more of Doctor Jekyll,&rsquo;
        he said in a loud, unsteady voice. &lsquo;I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any
        allusions to one whom I regard as dead.&rsquo;
