        <summary>Notes</summary>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Allegory</strong> – An allegory is when a story conveys a hidden meaning, often moral or political. Macbeth as a whole is an allegory about ambition: it shows how the desire for power can destroy not only the individual but the natural and moral order of the world.</li>
          <li><strong>Allusion</strong> – An allusion is an indirect reference. Shakespeare alludes to mythology when Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft, appears, and to history when the witches hail Banquo as the father of kings, foreshadowing James I’s lineage.</li>
          <li><strong>Archetype</strong> – An archetype is the original model of a character type. Macbeth is the archetype of the tragic hero, while Lady Macbeth embodies the archetype of the manipulative femme fatale.</li>
          <li><strong>Bathos</strong> – Bathos is an abrupt anti-climax, often comic. The drunken Porter scene, with its jokes about hell’s gate and alcohol, follows immediately after the murder of Duncan, breaking tension through humour.</li>
          <li><strong>Biblical language</strong> – Shakespeare frequently uses Biblical language, since religion dominated Jacobean society. For example, Macbeth fears that his crime will bring “judgment” in the afterlife, echoing Biblical justice.</li>
          <li><strong>Blazon</strong> – Blazon describes a woman’s beauty by listing her features. Shakespeare subverts this: Lady Macbeth is not admired for beauty, but her words and influence dominate scenes, such as when she commands Macbeth to “look like th’innocent flower, but be the serpent under’t.”</li>
          <li><strong>Caricature</strong> – A caricature exaggerates features for comic or grotesque effect. The witches, with their strange rhymes and monstrous ingredients like “eye of newt,” are caricatures of evil.</li>
          <li><strong>Colloquialism</strong> – A colloquialism is everyday language. The Porter speaks in a comic, colloquial tone, mocking drunkenness and human folly.</li>
          <li><strong>Comic relief</strong> – This leads to comic relief: the Porter relieves tension after Duncan’s bloody murder, though his words ironically mirror the themes of sin and hell.</li>
          <li><strong>Connotation</strong> – Connotation is the emotional association of words. When Macbeth sees the “dagger,” it connotes blood, guilt, and fate, not just a weapon.</li>
          <li><strong>Dichotomy</strong> – A dichotomy is a contrast between two opposites. The entire play is built on dichotomies: good vs. evil, reality vs. illusion, fate vs. free will.</li>
          <li><strong>Double entendre</strong> – A double entendre has two meanings. Lady Macbeth’s words, “A little water clears us of this deed,” can be read both literally and as a dangerously naïve dismissal of guilt.</li>
          <li><strong>Dysphemism</strong> – A dysphemism is a harsh term. Macbeth calls the murder a “bloody business,” emphasising brutality.</li>
          <li><strong>Epithet</strong> – An epithet is a descriptive phrase. Macbeth is introduced as “valiant cousin, worthy gentleman.”</li>
          <li><strong>Epitome</strong> – An epitome is a perfect example. Lady Macbeth is the epitome of ruthless ambition when she prays to be “unsexed.”</li>
          <li><strong>Epizeuxis</strong> – Epizeuxis is repetition in succession: Macbeth cries “Out, out, brief candle!” to stress life’s fragility.</li>
          <li><strong>Euphemism</strong> – A euphemism softens reality. Duncan’s murder is called his “taking off.”</li>
          <li><strong>Extended metaphor</strong> – An extended metaphor continues throughout a passage. Darkness in Macbeth works as an extended metaphor for evil and corruption.</li>
          <li><strong>Foreshadowing</strong> – Foreshadowing hints at later events. The witches’ “fair is foul, and foul is fair” foreshadows the moral confusion of the play.</li>
          <li><strong>Grotesque</strong> – The grotesque appears in the witches’ spell: “finger of birth-strangled babe,” both horrifying and unnatural.</li>
          <li><strong>Hyperbole</strong> – Hyperbole is exaggeration. Macbeth says that not even “all great Neptune’s ocean” could wash the blood from his hands.</li>
          <li><strong>Ideology</strong> – Ideology refers to beliefs. The play reflects the Jacobean ideology of the Divine Right of Kings: killing Duncan is not only murder but rebellion against God’s order.</li>
          <li><strong>Imagery</strong> – Imagery is vivid description. Blood imagery runs throughout the play as a symbol of guilt—Macbeth imagines his hands will make “the multitudinous seas incarnadine.”</li>
          <li><strong>Irony</strong> – Irony is when the opposite occurs. Duncan calls Macbeth’s castle “pleasant,” though he will be murdered inside it.</li>
          <li><strong>Juxtaposition</strong> – Juxtaposition places opposites side by side. Macbeth is brave in battle but cowardly in facing his conscience.</li>
          <li><strong>Manifestation</strong> – A manifestation is the physical form of an idea. Banquo’s ghost is the manifestation of Macbeth’s guilt.</li>
          <li><strong>Motif</strong> – A motif is a recurring element. Blood, darkness, and unnatural weather are key motifs.</li>
          <li><strong>Oxymoron</strong> – An oxymoron joins opposites. Macbeth says, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen.”</li>
          <li><strong>Parable</strong> – A parable is a story teaching a lesson. Macbeth can be read as a parable warning against ambition and regicide.</li>
          <li><strong>Pathetic fallacy</strong> – Pathetic fallacy gives nature human feelings. After Duncan’s murder, the horses eat each other and the day turns dark.</li>
          <li><strong>Personification</strong> – Personification gives life to objects. Macbeth asks the stars to “hide their fires.”</li>
          <li><strong>Pun</strong> – A pun plays on double meanings. The Porter jokes about lying in bed and lying to others.</li>
          <li><strong>Satire</strong> – Satire uses humour to criticise. The Porter satirises the corruption of society and drunkenness.</li>
          <li><strong>Semantic field</strong> – A semantic field is a set of related words. Shakespeare creates a semantic field of darkness: “night,” “black,” “shade.”</li>
          <li><strong>Sibilance</strong> – Sibilance is repetition of ‘s’ sounds. “Stars, hide your fires” creates secrecy and menace.</li>
          <li><strong>Simile</strong> – A simile compares with “like” or “as.” Duncan’s wounds are described “as silver skin laced with golden blood.”</li>
          <li><strong>Symbolism</strong> – Symbolism uses objects to represent ideas. Blood symbolises guilt, the crown symbolises power.</li>
          <li><strong>Trope</strong> – A trope is a recurring story type. The witches embody the trope of the evil prophecy.</li>
          <li><strong>Zoomorphism</strong> – Zoomorphism gives animal qualities. Lady Macbeth urges Macbeth to be the “serpent under’t.”</li>
